      `My name is [Your Name], and I am a visual artist and designer whose practice centers on drawing as both a thinking tool and an expressive language. I am writing to express my sincere interest in the [Residency Name] as a space to deepen a body of work that investigates [insert project theme—e.g., memory, place, movement, etc.] through the medium of drawing.`,

    `Drawing, for me, is not only a vi time, space, and experimentation. I see it as the perfect context to expand my drawing practice beyond its current boundaries, allowing for daily immersion, exploration of materials, and reflection.`,
    `Drawing, for me, is not only a visual output but a method of inquiry—of observing, understanding, and recording. I am particularly drawn to your residency for its emphasis on time, space, and experimentation. I see it as the perfect context to expand my drawing practice beyond its current boundaries, allowing for daily immersion, exploration of materials, and reflection.`,
      `The project I intend to begin during the residency is titled [Project Title]. It will be an evolving series of drawings that [describe concept briefly—e.g., map emotional geographies, abstract environmental data, reinterpret local histories, etc.]. Starting from a place of observation, the drawings will develop through repetition, abstraction, and layering—allowing the process itself to lead the direction of the work.`,
      `My approach during the residency will be highly process-based: I intend to engage in drawing as a daily ritual, using a variety of media (graphite, ink, collage, etc.) while responding to the physical and emotional atmosphere of the residency setting. I hope to also invite feedback through open studio discussions or informal critiques if the structure allows.`,

      `Being selected would offer me the invaluable gift of uninterrupted time and a nurturing environment to experiment and reflect.
